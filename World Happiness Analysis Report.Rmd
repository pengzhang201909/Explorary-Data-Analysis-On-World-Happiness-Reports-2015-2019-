## Introduction

Everyone is looking for happiness. Then what factors influence man's feeling about happiness? Great income, healthy body, perfect family, enough freedom, generous neighbourhood and community, incorruptible governance,... It looks every individual factor does not define happiness directly but to some extent they play their roles in the process of how to feel happiness.

In this report we will analyze three characteristics of happiness across the world. First what was the trend of world happiness ranking recently. In other words, the world felt more happiness, or in reverse? Then, are countries more happier if they are more democratic? At last we will focus on some countries which have experienced huge happiness ranking changes, and try to find the reasons.

Certainly in this report we will use the UN World Happiness Reports from 2015 to 2019, and explorary data analysis tools in R.

Thank the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network for providing World Happiness Report annually. Let's have this opportunity of Quantitative Analysis on World Happiness.

We were excited to find the UN World Happiness Reports have an index called as national happiness score  as well as six correlative life factors, which comprise a system of indicators to rank happiness across the world. The rankings of national happiness are based on a Cantril ladder survey. Nationally representative samples of respondents are asked to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10, and the worst possible life being a 0. They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale.

Q1, What was the trend of world happiness scores from 2015 to 2019? In general, people felt more happiness from 2015 to 2019?

Q2, Are countries more happier if they have more democratic freedoms?

Q3, from 2015 to 2019, which countries experienced huge happiness score change , both positive and negtive?

## Data Cleaning

### 3E Rules

When facing the five World Happiness Report datasets, I remembered the three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy: 1. each variable must have its own column; 2. each observation must have its own row; 3. each value must have its own cell. These rules(I call it 3E Rules) were just what I followed when cleaning datasets in this project.

### Decide tidy dataset columns

Firstly I found there were 9 common variables in five datasets: rank, country, score, gdp per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom, generosity, trust. First three of them  delivered informations about countries' names and their happiness ranking, the other were six key explanatory factors. Nevermind they had differnet names in different reports sometimes, I could easily find they were pointing to the same variables. For example, in 2015 report dataset there was a variable "Trust (Government Corruption)",then in 2018 and 2019 report datasets a variable "Perceptions of corruption" has taken the place. Because these variables had necessary informations to answer our questions I'd like to use the nine variables to create new tidy data frame.

However in 2015,2016 and 2017 reports datasets variable "family" came out instead of "social support". I seached the official website for this variable( https://worldhappiness.report/ ). There was only social support in the documentations throughout five years reports. So I treated "family" as input error and replaced it with "social support".

To analyze the changing trend of happiness among countries in the five years, I added time dimension with mutating column "year" .

When we have year and score columns, it's easy to caculate the ranking sequence for each country per year. Then I dropped the rank column off. Now nine columns again!

### Missing values

When reviewing the five original datasets in .csv type, I did NOT see any N/A character at all. After importing datasets, I met a problem when joining datasets. A warning message came out like this :
"Error: Column `trust` can't be converted from numeric to factor." I had to check "trust" column in every dataset, only 2018.csv had "trust" column(origin was "Perceptions.of.corruption") treated as factor. Keeping forward, I carefully reviewed any element of this column until meeting a N/A. This observation has country name as United Arab Emirates with happiness rank 20 in 2018. From the documentations, I learned one regular technical remedy action was to borrow the value of last year.  

I found some 0's presenting the values of a couple of key explanatory factors. They might be missing or not. According to the documentations, 0 represented the worst possible life in the Cantril ladder survey. It was an option and had possibility. Because I did not know how to do with it , so I kept those 0's. Luckily I did not find any happiness score with the value of 0!!!Just a joke.



### Dropped those countries which did not existed in all five years' datasets

For keeping our analysis in a continous time dimension, I took out of those observations whose countries' names did not have five years' records. However there were a couple of execptions. "Hong Kong" and "Taiwan" existed in 2015, 2016,2018 and 2019 reports except 2017, because the name of "Hong Kong S.A.R., China" and "Taiwan Province of China" have taken them in this year report. I restored the names of "Hong Kong" and "Taiwan" to 2017 dataset.   

```{r}
w_15 <- read.csv("2015.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
w_16 <- read.csv("2016.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
w_17 <- read.csv("2017.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
w_18 <- read.csv("2018revised.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
w_19 <- read.csv("2019.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```


```{r}
w_15$year <- 2015
#glimpse(w_15)
```

```{r}
w_15 <- w_15 %>% select(-2,-3,-5,-12) %>% rename( 
"country" = "Country", "score" = "Happiness.Score", "gdp" = "Economy..GDP.per.Capita.", "socsupport" = "Family", "lexp" = "Health..Life.Expectancy.", "freedom" = "Freedom", "generosity" = "Generosity", "trust" = "Trust..Government.Corruption.")
#glimpse(w_15)
```


```{r}
w_16$year <- 2016
#glimpse(w_16)
```

```{r}
w_16 <- w_16 %>% select(-2,-3,-5,-6,-13) %>% rename("country" = "Country", "score" = "Happiness.Score", "gdp" = "Economy..GDP.per.Capita.", "socsupport" = "Family", "lexp" = "Health..Life.Expectancy.", "freedom" = "Freedom", "generosity" = "Generosity", "trust" = "Trust..Government.Corruption.")
#glimpse(w_16)
```

```{r}
w_17$year <- 2017
#glimpse(w_17)
```

```{r}
w_17 <- w_17 %>% 
  select(-2,-4,-5,-12) %>% 
  rename("country" = "Country", "score" = "Happiness.Score", "gdp" = "Economy..GDP.per.Capita.", "socsupport" = "Family", "lexp" = "Health..Life.Expectancy.", "freedom" = "Freedom", "generosity" = "Generosity", "trust" = "Trust..Government.Corruption.")
w_17$country[71] = "Hong Kong"
w_17$country[33] = "Taiwan"
#glimpse(w_17)
```

```{r}
w_18$year <- 2018
#glimpse(w_18)
```

```{r}
w_18 <- w_18 %>% select(-1) %>% rename("country" = "Country.or.region", "score" = "Score", "gdp" = "GDP.per.capita", "socsupport" = "Social.support", "lexp" = "Healthy.life.expectancy", "freedom" = "Freedom.to.make.life.choices", "generosity" = "Generosity", "trust" = "Perceptions.of.corruption")
w_18$country[141] = "Trinidad and Tobago"
#glimpse(w_18)
```

```{r}
w_19$year <- 2019
#glimpse(w_19)
```

```{r}
w_19 <- w_19 %>% select(-1) %>% rename("country" = "Country.or.region", "score" = "Score", "gdp" = "GDP.per.capita", "socsupport" = "Social.support", "lexp" = "Healthy.life.expectancy", "freedom" = "Freedom.to.make.life.choices", "generosity" = "Generosity", "trust" = "Perceptions.of.corruption")
w_19$country[141] = "Trinidad and Tobago"
#glimpse(w_19)
```


```{r}
w <- bind_rows(w_15,w_16,w_17,w_18,w_19)
```


```{r}
#Drop the countries that were not included in all 5 years. 2015+2016+2017+2018+2019 = 10085
w2 <- w %>% group_by(country) %>% mutate(count = sum(year)) %>% dplyr::filter(count == 10085)
w2 <- w2 %>% select(-10) %>%
  mutate(gdp = round(gdp,3),
         socsupport = round(socsupport,3),
         lexp=round(lexp,3),
         freedom=round(freedom,3),
         trust=round(trust,3),
         generosity=round(generosity,3))
#glimpse(w2)
```
