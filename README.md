Explorary Data Analysis On UN World Happiness Reports(2015-2019)

### Introduction

Everyone is looking for happiness. Then what factors influence man's feeling about happiness? Great income, healthy body, perfect family, enough freedom, generous neighbourhood and community, incorruptible governance,... It looks every individual factor does not define happiness directly but to some extent they play their roles in the process of how to feel happiness.

In this report we will analyze three characteristics of happiness across the world. First what was the trend of world happiness ranking recently. In other words, the world felt more happiness, or in reverse? Then, we'll analyze the relationship between the happiness score and countries with the most democratic freedoms. At last we will focus on some countries which have experienced huge happiness ranking changes, and try to find the reasons.

Certainly in this interesting analysis journey we will use the UN World Happiness Reports from 2015 to 2019, and explorary data analysis tools in R.

Thank the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network for providing World Happiness Report annually. Let's have this opportunity of Quantitative Analysis on World Happiness.

We were excited to find the UN World Happiness Reports have an index called as national happiness score  as well as six correlative life factors, which comprise a system of indicators to rank happiness across the world. The rankings of national happiness are based on a Cantril ladder survey. Nationally representative samples of respondents are asked to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10, and the worst possible life being a 0. They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale.
