World Happiness and Democracy
Explorary Data Analysis On UN World Happiness Reports(2015-2019)

Introduction

Everyone is looking for happiness. Then what factors influence man's feeling about happiness? Great income, healthy body, perfect family, enough freedom, generous neighbourhood and community, incorruptible governance, democratic freedom... It looks every individual factor does not define happiness directly but to some extent they play their roles in the process of how to feel happiness.

Thank the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network for providing World Happiness Report annually. Let's have this opportunity of Quantitative Analysis on World Happiness.

The UN World Happiness Reports have an index called as national happiness score  as well as six correlative life factors, which comprise a system of indicators to rank happiness across the world. The rankings of national happiness are based on a Cantril ladder survey. Nationally representative samples of respondents are asked to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10, and the worst possible life being a 0. They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale.

Based on explorary data analysis of world Happiness Reports we would like to answer a question: Is the world a happy place for people? Moreover, in the past half year, the people of Hong Kong have shown a strong spirit of pursuit for more democratic freedoms through widespread protests. These events led us to wonder if there's a strong relationship between democracy and happiness.
